# Refreshing The Mario Game According To Software Engineering Principles

### Description of Repo

- This project was made for software engineering course. The project was prepared with six computer engineering students and graphic design students. The aim of the project is to practice the subjects we learned in the software engineering course throughout the semester. As a task, we chose a 2d computer game and found the missing areas according to software engineering principles, determined its functional and non-functional requirements, created the algorithm with diagrams and then implemented it.

# YEDITEPE UNIVERSITY SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TERM PROJECT

- In this project we tried to improve the old mario game with software engineering principles. When we play first time game named Mario we liked so much but we lost our interest, we think how can we gain the interest again then we identified the lacks(eksiklik) in the game and thought about how we can make the game more enjoyable. We found some ideas. Our favorite idea was the music box. The user may die several times in some levels and this will cause them to get bored. To prevent this situation, we added musicboxes that play random music to the game. When Mario touches these boxes, the music starts playing and if Mario touches the same box again, the music changes. The other development idea is the rising water. This idea already exists in different games. We adapted this for Mario as racing against time will increase the enjoyment of the game.
