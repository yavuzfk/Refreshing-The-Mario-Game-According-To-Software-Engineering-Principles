# Description of Repo

- This project was made for software engineering course. The project was prepared with six computer engineering students and graphic design students. The aim of the project is to practice the subjects we learned in the software engineering course throughout the semester. As a task, we chose a 2d computer game and found the missing areas according to software engineering principles, determined its functional and non-functional requirements, created the algorithm with diagrams and then implemented it.
